_I became tired of having to search online for a QR Code sample._

_Every one of them uses JQuery, or relies on some external library that is loaded with mountains of bloatware, or worse ask you to pay a subscription just to use it!_

_Since this script was directly written in JavaScript using methods that rely directly on base64 bytes, **it is therefore not only the lightest QR Scanner on resources to exist for browsers.. But it is also the fastest at rendering in real time.**_

_Enjoy, all that I ask is you reference [me](https://www.charlesderek.com/)._
